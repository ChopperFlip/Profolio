Title: Qutebrowser set up

Brief Description: This is my personal setup on Qutebrowser

Why: I wanted to test Qutebrowser for the idea of navigation via keyboard interested me.
        I also wanted to skip youtube ads while keeping a dark mode theme for my eyes.
            Realizing Qutebrowser accepts config.py means one could customize anything on this browser and it's a nice application of the code language.

Quick Start: 1. Install Qutebrowser for you OS.
             2. Access your .config directory via gui (it's under hidden files) and open your config.py file.
             2b.nano ~/.config/qutebrowswer/config.py via terminal
             3. copy and paste my config into yours and boom you copied my set up.
             4. NOTE THE DEFAULT f FOR SELECTION WILL PLAY THE WEB'S VIDEO, YOU NEED TO SELECT VIA M (shift+m).

Usage: Skips Youtube ads completely via bypass.
        The Youtube platform uploads media files that's played via stream that's live on web browser. This config creates an mpv application that uploads and plays those media files skipping the Youtube ads.
        TLDR; you play the media file directly avoiding Youtube's involvement and yes it can play live media.


        If you want to keep Youtube's involvement, then look inside the greasemoney folder for the it's a script to automatically skip ads.
